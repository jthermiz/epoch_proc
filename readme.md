# Epoch Processing Library
This is a Matlab library that performs operations on a epoched data. The epoched or trialized data structure *Tr* contains data and associated meta-data. A descriptions of the fields is provided below:

- Tr.data = trials x samples x channels, tensor of epoched data
- Tr.time = 1 x samples relative timeline wrt to event
- Tr.atime = trials x time stamps in seconds
- Tr.type = 1 x trials labels for each trial
- Tr.idx = 1 x channels of channel name numbers
- Tr.imp = 1 x channels of channel impedances
- Tr.fs = scalar sampling rate

## Installation
Download this library and add the folder along with the sub-folders to your Matlab path.

## Getting Started
For an example of a processing pipeline, run `example.m`. In the example, random data is created and converted to the *Tr* structure. The `epoch_kwd.m` function converts `.kwd` data generated by *Open Ephys* into *Tr* structure.
